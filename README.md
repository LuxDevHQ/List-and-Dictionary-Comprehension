# Python Comprehensions: Peer Work on Lists and Dictionaries

## Assignment Title
**Peer Programming Task: List and Dictionary Comprehensions in Python**

## Objective
To enhance your understanding and practical skills in Python by working with peers to solve real-world problems using **list** and **dictionary comprehensions**.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this task, students will be able to:
- Use list comprehensions to manipulate and filter data
- Use dictionary comprehensions to create and transform key-value pairs
- Collaborate with peers to debug and improve code
- Present optimized Pythonic solutions

## Task Description
You and your peer(s) will complete the following two tasks:

### Task 1: List Comprehension – Student Grades

You are given a list of student scores:

```python
scores = [45, 78, 88, 56, 90, 62, 33, 99, 70, 50]
```

**Instructions:**
1. Use a list comprehension to filter all the **scores above 60** and store them in a new list called `passed`.
2. Use another list comprehension to convert all scores into **"Pass"** or **"Fail"** using a threshold of 50.

```python
# Example output: ['Fail', 'Pass', 'Pass', ...]
```

### Task 2: Dictionary Comprehension – Student Report

You are given two lists:

```python
students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve']
marks = [82, 48, 79, 65, 91]
```

**Instructions:**
1. Create a dictionary using comprehension that pairs each student with their mark.
2. Create a second dictionary that stores **only students who scored more than 70**.
3. Create a third dictionary that maps each student to `"Pass"` or `"Fail"` (threshold: 50).

### Bonus Challenge (for advanced learners)

Given a sentence:

```python
sentence = "Data science is fun and insightful"
```

Write a dictionary comprehension that maps each **word** to its **length**.

## Submission Guidelines
- Work in **pairs** or **groups of 3**
- Submit a `.py` file with your solutions, including comments
- Each member should explain **one part** of the code during the class review
